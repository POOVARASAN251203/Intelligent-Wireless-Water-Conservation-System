# Intelligent-Wireless-Water-Conservation-System

Creating a wireless water conservation system involves connecting components like NodeMCU, ultrasonic sensors, motorized water pump, and developing code for their interaction. Here is a step-by-step procedure for connection and coding:

### Components Needed:
1. 2 x NodeMCU boards (as Server and Client)
2. Ultrasonic Sensor
3. Motorized Water Pump
4. Mobile App (for remote monitoring) - Blynk

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

#### 1. Connection Setup:

##### Server Side (NodeMCU 1 - Server):
- Connect the ultrasonic sensor to NodeMCU 1.
- Connect NodeMCU 1 to a Wi-Fi network.

##### Client Side (NodeMCU 2 - Client):
- Connect the motorized water pump to NodeMCU 2.
- Connect NodeMCU 2 to the same Wi-Fi network as NodeMCU 1.

#### 2. Coding: (Uploaded in folder Code)

##### Server Side (NodeMCU 1 - Server):
- Write code to read data from the ultrasonic sensor to determine the water line.
- Based on the water line, send control signals to NodeMCU 2 (Client) to manage the water pump.
- Transmit water line information to the mobile app for remote monitoring.

##### Client Side (NodeMCU 2 - Client):
- Write code to receive water line data from NodeMCU 1 (Server).
- Process the received data to decide whether to switch the water pump on or off.
- Implement communication between the mobile app and NodeMCU 2 for remote control and monitoring.

#### 3. Testing:

- Simulate different water levels to verify if the water pump turns on/off automatically as intended.
- Test the mobile app to ensure it receives real-time water line updates and can control the water pump remotely.

#### 4. Deployment:

- Deploy the system in a real-world environment, monitor its performance, and make necessary adjustments if required.
- Regularly check for hardware or software issues and update the system software as needed.

### Coding Guidelines:

#### Libraries:
- Utilize relevant libraries for NodeMCU, ultrasonic sensors, and Wi-Fi connectivity (like Arduino IDE or other compatible libraries).

#### Functions:
- Implement functions to read sensor data, process it, and control the water pump accordingly.
- Create functions for transmitting data between NodeMCUs and the mobile app.

#### Communication Protocol:
- Use a reliable communication protocol (like MQTT or HTTP) for seamless interaction between NodeMCUs and the mobile app.

#### Error Handling:
- Include error handling mechanisms in the code to manage unexpected situations or sensor malfunctions.

#### User Interface (Mobile App):
- Develop a user-friendly interface for the mobile app displaying water levels and providing control options for the water pump.

### Final Considerations:

- Regularly update and maintain the system for optimal performance.
- Test the system thoroughly to ensure reliability and accuracy in water level detection and pump control.

Please note that specific code implementation and connections may vary based on the exact hardware components and the programming language used. Always refer to the respective component datasheets and documentation for precise wiring diagrams and coding instructions.
